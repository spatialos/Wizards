# Wizards! (SpatialOS)

> **Important notice:** We are retiring the Wizards project! This repository will remain in place, but we no longer recommend Wizards as part of your path to learning about SpatialOS. For a better experience, get hands-on with the [Pirates tutorial](https://github.com/spatialos/PiratesTutorial), learn the [core concepts of SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos), and read about tools for [running a live game](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/operate/inspector).

### Introduction

This repository contains a demo project built with [SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/concepts/spatialos).
It demonstrates how to use SpatialOS to build a large and compelling simulated world.

The project serves as a starting point for the [hands-on SpatialOS product demo](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/get-started/tour).

The main documentation for SpatialOS can be found [here](https://spatialos.improbable.io/docs/reference/13.0/index).

If you run into problems, or want to give us feedback, please visit the [SpatialOS forums](https://forums.improbable.io/).

**New from June 2018: The SpatialOS Unity GDK**<br/>
Check out the pre-alpha release of our new Unity GDK: [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/spatialos.com/UnityGDK). Using the Unity Entity Component System (ECS), the GDK is the next evolution in SpatialOS Unity game development. See our [blog post on ECS-powered multiplayer](https://improbable.io/games/blog/unity-gdk-our-first-steps) for more information.
<br/>
<br/>
**Note:** The pre-alpha GDK version is available for evaluation and feedback only. It's not yet game-development ready.
